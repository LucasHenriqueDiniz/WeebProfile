# Railway deploy notes (workspace)

## Ports
- Prefer `PORT` (Railway) and allow `SVG_GENERATOR_PORT` locally.
- Bind to `0.0.0.0` on Railway; `localhost` locally.

## Environment
- `DATABASE_URL` must be provided in Railway variables.
- Avoid assumptions about filesystem persistence.

## Startup
- Keep startup logs concise; avoid dumping full request payloads by default.
