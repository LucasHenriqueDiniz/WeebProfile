# Templates + compatibility rules

## Consumers
This package is consumed by multiple apps. Assume:
- Node build step
- React rendering in different environments

## Rules
- Keep templates framework-agnostic (no Next.js-only APIs).
- Keep components pure and deterministic (no data fetching here).
- Do not change exported component names/paths without updating all imports.

## Rendering
- Prefer small presentational components used by plugins.
- Keep prop types explicit and exported where reused.
